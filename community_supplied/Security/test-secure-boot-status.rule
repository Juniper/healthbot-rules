/*
 * This rule checks if secure boot is running and enforced and returns

 *
 * This rule relies on a file present in 19.3R1 and beyond.
 * This rule is only applicible to devices where secure boot is capable.
 * If this rule is run on a device that is incapable of secure boot,
 * the result will be "secureboot status is unknonw" and the rule should be
 * removed.
