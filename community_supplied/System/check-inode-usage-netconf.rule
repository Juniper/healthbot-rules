/*
* Monitors the inode usage on the system and notifies
* when anomalies are found
* Three input control detection
*
* 1) filename-var, is a regular expression that matches the filenames
* that you would like to monitor. By default it's ".*", which matches
* all filenames.
*
* 2) high-threshold-var, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
* an anomaly. By default high threshold value is set to 80.00 %. This rule
* will set a dashboard color to red when inode usage percent exceeds the
* high threshold value.
*
* 3) low-threshold-var, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
* an anomaly. By default low threshold value is set to 50.00 %. This rule
* will set a dashboard color to yellow when inode usage percent exceeds the
* low threshold value. Otherwise it is set to green.
