* Monitors tcam  usage and notifies when anomalies are found on QFX5K.
* 
* Four input control detection
*
* 1) high-threshold-var,  is the threshold that causes the rule to report
* an anomaly. By default it is 80.00 %. This rule will set a
* dashboard color to red when file descriptor usage percent
* exceeds threshold value.
*
* 2) low-threshold-var, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
* an anomaly. By default it is 50.00 %. This rule will set a
* dashboard color to yellow when file descriptor usage percent
* exceeds threshold value in time range of 2 days. Otherwise
* it is set to green.
*
* 3) group-name variable,  is the name of the ingress and egress filter groups.
* 
* 4) unit-number variable , is the unit number under the slot.
