/*
 * Detects chassis temperature threshold breaches and notifies when anomalies
 * are found.
 * Two inputs control detection
 * 
 *   1) "chassis-temperature-low-threshold" is the threshold that causes the
 *      rule to report an anomaly. By default it's 45 degree Cecilius of 
 *      chassis temperature. This rule will set a dashboard color to green
 *      when temperature is below low threshold.
 * 
 *   2) "chassis-temperature-high-threshold" is the threshold that causes the
 *      rule to report an anomaly. By default it's 55 degree Cecilius of 
 *      chassis temperature. This rule will set a dashboard color to yellow
 *      when temperature is below high threshold. Otherwise color is set to
 *      red and notify anomaly.
