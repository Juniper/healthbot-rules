/*
 * Checks if graceful-switchover is configured on a dual RE chassis or not
 *
 * First checks if other routing engine is present or not. If present, checks
 * if failover (set chassis redundancy graceful-switchover) is configured or not.
 * 
 * In dual RE chassis, for high availability it is recommended to have faiover
 * configured. A yellow color is reported if this configuration is not found
 * in a dual Routing Engine chassis.
