/*
 * Check failover Initialization error
 *
 * Checks if Ksyncd (Junos Kernel State Synchronization daemon) has reported an
 * initialization error or not.
 *
 * Ksyncd cleans up the FIB states on replicated routing engine before it
 * starts to resync the FIB states from the Master routing engine. It is possible
 * for this cleanup to fail in certain scenarios. But, if these cleanup failures
 * are persistent and are seen for more than 30 minutes, it can comprise high
 * availability feature and should be reported.
 *
 * Rebooting backup RE should help in recovery.
