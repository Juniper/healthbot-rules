/*
 * Detects routing-engine temperature threshold breaches and notifies when
 * anomalies are found.
 * Three inputs control detection
 *
 *   1) "re-slot-no" is a regular expression that matches the routing engine
 *      that you would like to monitor.  By default it's '0-1', which matches
 *      both the routing engines. Use something like '0' to match only
 *      routing engine 0.
 *
 *   2) "re-temperature-low-threshold" is the threshold that causes the
 *      rule to report an anomaly. By default it's 45 degree Cecilius of 
 *      RE temperature. This rule will set a dashboard color to green
 *      when temperature is below low threshold.
 * 
 *   3) "re-temperature-high-threshold" is the threshold that causes the
 *      rule to report an anomaly. By default it's 55 degree Cecilius of RE 
 *      temperature. This rule will set a dashboard color to yellow when
 *      temperature is below high threshold. Otherwise color is set to
 *      red and notify anomaly.
