/*
 * Detects linecards cpu, memory utilization threshold breaches, state,temperature 
 * and notifies when anomalies are found.
 * Seven inputs control detection
 * 
 *   1) "fpc-slot-no" is a regular expression that matches the linecard
 *      that you would like to monitor.  By default it's '0-20', which matches
 *      FPC 0 to 20 linecards. Use something like '0-3' to match only specific
 *      FPCs i.e. 0 to 3.
 * 
 *   2) "fpc-buffer-high-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 80% of memory buffer utilization.
 *      This rule will set a dashboard color to red when FPC memory buffer
 *      utilization exceed high threshold 'fpc-buffer-high-threshold' for a
 *      period of 3 minutes.
 * 
 *   3) "fpc-buffer-low-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 50% of memory buffer utilization.
 *      This rule will set a dashboard color to yellow when FPC memory buffer
 *      utilization exceed low threshold 'fpc-buffer-low-threshold' for a
 *      period of 3 minutes.
 * 
 *   4) "fpc-heap-high-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 80% of memory heap utilization.
 *      This rule will set a dashboard color to red when FPC memory heap
 *      utilization exceed high threshold 'fpc-heap-high-threshold' for a
 *      period of 3 minutes.
 * 
 *   5) "fpc-heap-low-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 50% of memory heap utilization.
 *      This rule will set a dashboard color to yellow when FPC memory heap
 *      utilization exceed low threshold 'fpc-heap-low-threshold' for a
 *      period of 3 minutes.
 *
 *   6) "fpc-cpu-high-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to report
 *      an anomaly. By default it's 80% of CPU utilization. This rule will set
 *      a dashboard color to red when FPC CPU utilization exceed high threshold
 *      'fpc-cpu-high-threshold' for a period of 3 minutes.
 * 
 *   7) "fpc-cpu-low-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to report
 *      an anomaly. By default it's 50% of CPU utilization. This rule will set 
 *      a dashboard color to yellow when RE CPU utilization exceed low 
 *      threshold 'fpc-cpu-low-threshold' for a period of 3 minutes.
 *      Otherwise color is set to green.
