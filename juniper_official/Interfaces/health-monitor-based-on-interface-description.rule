/*
 * Filters interfaces based on keyword of an interface description. Monitors
 * only filtered interfaces based on selective KPI.
 * Using this playbook any one of the interface KPI (in-octets, out-octets,
 * in-pkts, out-pkts, in-unicast-pkts, out-unicast-pkts, in-errors, out-errors,
 * carrier-transitions) will be monitored.
 *
 * ****Separate playbook instances to be created for each interface kpi****
 * By default it monitors input traffic and notifies when utilization is above
 * threshold
 * Four inputs control detection
 *
 *   1) interface-description, is a regular expression that matches the keyword
 *      in interface description and filters interfaces that you would like to
 *      monitor. By default it's '.+', which matches all interfaces contains
 *      description. Use something like 'core' to match only interfaces which
 *      contains keyword 'core' in interface description.
 *
 *   2) stats-name-variable, is a regular expression that matches the interface KPI
 *      statistics counter name that you would like to monitor. By default it's
 *      in-octets, Use proper counter name something like 'out-octets' or
 *      "in-errors" or "out-errors" etc.
 *
 *   3) high-threshold-variable, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
 *      an anomaly.  By default it's 800000000 octets . This rule will set a
 *      dashboard color to red when *filtered interfaces* the input traffic
 *      is above threshold for 60s. Use 8000000000 octets for 10G & 80000000000
 *      for 100G interface.
 *
 *   4) medium-threshold-variable, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
 *      an anomaly.  By default it's 500000000 octets . This rule will set a
 *      dashboard color to yellow when *filtered interfaces* the input traffic
 *      is above threshold for 60s, otherwise color is set to green. Use
 *      5000000000 octets for 10G & 50000000000 for 100G interface.
