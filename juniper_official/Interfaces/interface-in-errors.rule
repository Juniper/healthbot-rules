/*
 * Detects interface in errors and notifies when anomalies are found.
 * Two inputs control detection
 * 
 *   1) interface-name-variable, is a regular expression that matches the
 *      interfaces that you would like to monitor.  By default it's
 *      '.*', which matches all interfaces. Use something like 'ge.*' to
 *      match only gigabit ethernet interfaces.
 * 
 *   2) in-errors-threshold-variable, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
 *      an anomaly.  By default it's 1. This rule will set a dashboard
 *      color to red when *all* the error increases are greater than
 *      'in-errors-threshold-variable' for 180s. If it sees any errors increase for a
 *      period of less than 180s, it'll turn the color to yellow,
 *      otherwise color is set to green.
 *
 *   3) in-errors-stats-name, is the error stats counter name in-error which is
 *      cumaulative of in-fram-errors, in-resource-errors, in-giants, in-drops,
 *      in-discards and mtu-errors. Default value is in-errors.
