/*
 * Monitors interface input traffic and notifies when anomalies are found.
 * Four inputs control detection
 *
 *   1) interface_name, is a regular expression that matches the
 *      interfaces that you would like to monitor.  By default it's
 *      '.*', which matches all interfaces. Use something like 'ge.*' to
 *      match only gigabit ethernet interfaces.
 *
 *   2) stats_name, is a regular expression that matches the interface KPI
 *      statistics counter name that you would like to monitor. By default it's
 *      in-octets, Use proper counter name something like 'in-pkts' or
 *      "in-unicast-pkts" or "in-multicast-pkts" etc.
 *
 *   3) in_octets_high_threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to 
 *      report an anomaly.  By default it's 800000000 octets. This rule will 
 *      set a dashboard color to red when *all* the input traffic is above 
 *      threshold for 60 seconds period. Use 8000000000 octets for 10G &
 *      80000000000 for 100G interface.
 *
 *   4) in_octets_low_threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to
 *      report an anomaly.  By default it's 500000000 octets . This rule will
 *      set a dashboard color to yellow when *all* the input traffic is above
 *      threshold for 60 seconds period, otherwise color is set to green.
 *      Use 5000000000 octets for 10G & 50000000000 for 100G interface.
