/*
 * Monitors interface output traffic and notifies when anomalies are found.
 * Four inputs control detection
 *
 *   1) interface-name-variable, is a regular expression that matches the
 *      interfaces that you would like to monitor.  By default it's
 *      '.*', which matches all interfaces. Use something like 'ge.*' to
 *      match only gigabit ethernet interfaces.
 *
 *   2) out-octets-stats-name, is a regular expression that matches the interface KPI
 *      statistics counter name that you would like to monitor. By default it's
 *      out-octets, Use proper counter name something like 'out-pkts' or
 *      "out-unicast-pkts" or "out-multicast-pkts" etc.
 *
 *   3) out-octets-high-threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
 *      an anomaly.  By default it's 800000000 octets. This rule will set a
 *      dashboard color to red when *all* the output traffic exceed threshold
 *      for 180s. Use 8000000000 octets for 10G & 80000000000 for 100G interface. 
 *
 *   4) out-octets-low-threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
 *      an anomaly.  By default it's 500000000 octets . This rule will set a
 *      dashboard color to yellow when *all* the output traffic exceed 
 *      threshold for 180s, otherwise color is set to green. Use 5000000000
 *      octets for 10G & 50000000000 for 100G interface.
