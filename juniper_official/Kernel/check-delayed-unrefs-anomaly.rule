/*
 * This rule checks if there are any delayed unrefs and if they are greater than
 * a particular threshol (sysctl net.rt_nh_max_delayed_unrefs).
 *
 * Transient spikes in delayed unref count is expected in certain catastrophic or
 * major events and is not a cause for worry. But, if this situation persists for
 * significant amount of time (say in minutes), then it can result in traffic loss.
