/*
 * Peer infra module is responsible for replicating FIB states to the line cards
 * and also to process incoming IPCs from them. Each line card has a connection
 * with Master Routing Engine Junos Kernel, and a peer proxy kernel thread
 * represents this remote line card in the Junos Kernel.
 *
 * If the peer proxy kernel thread gets woken up spuriously (i.e. without any
 * pending events to be processed), it can result in performance issues and
 * should thus be monitored. This rule does exactly that.
