/*
 * This rule checks if there are any stuck ifstate clients present in the system.
 * Though rare, but when any Ifstate client (application/FPC peer) gets stuck,
 * it can result in resource accumulation and eventually can lead to traffic loss.
 *
 * It checks if the "slow peers" alarm has been raised on the device.
