/*
 * This rule checks if there are any stuck ifstate clients present in the system.
 *
 * A stuck Ifstate client can cause resource release issues and eventually lead to
 * Kernel to veto incoming routing socket messages from applications, which further
 * can result in traffic loss. Though very rare, if this happens, it is a serious
 * condition and should be mitigated asap by restarting the client. See readme
 * in healthbot rules folder for details.
