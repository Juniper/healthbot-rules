/*
 * This rule checks for the number of dead ifstates at any given time in
 * the system. A dead Ifstate gets garbage collected once all the consumers
 * see the corresponding delete message. If these dead ifstates continue to
 * pile up, this indicates a garbage collection problem and can eat up
 * significant resources such as memory and indices.
 *
 * This rule monitors the number of dead Ifstates and raises an alarm if there
 * are too many of these (> 50% of alive ifstates) detected for significant
 * duration of time (1 hour).
