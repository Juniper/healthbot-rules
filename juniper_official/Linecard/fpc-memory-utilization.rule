/*
 * Detects linecards memory utilization threshold breaches and notifies when
 * anomalies are found.
 * Five inputs control detection
 * 
 *   1) "fpc-slot-no" is a regular expression that matches the linecard
 *      that you would like to monitor.  By default it's '0-20', which matches
 *      FPC 0 to 20 linecards. Use something like '0-3' to match only specific
 *      FPCs i.e. 0 to 3.
 * 
 *   2) "fpc-buffer-high-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 80% of memory buffer utilization.
 *      This rule will set a dashboard color to red when FPC memory buffer
 *      utilization exceed high threshold 'fpc-buffer-high-threshold' for a
 *      period of 3 minutes.
 * 
 *   3) "fpc-buffer-low-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 50% of memory buffer utilization.
 *      This rule will set a dashboard color to yellow when FPC memory buffer
 *      utilization exceed low threshold 'fpc-buffer-low-threshold' for a
 *      period of 3 minutes.
  * 
 *   4) "fpc-heap-high-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 80% of memory heap utilization.
 *      This rule will set a dashboard color to red when FPC memory heap
 *      utilization exceed high threshold 'fpc-heap-high-threshold' for a
 *      period of 3 minutes.
 * 
 *   5) "fpc-heap-low-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 50% of memory heap utilization.
 *      This rule will set a dashboard color to yellow when FPC memory heap
 *      utilization exceed low threshold 'fpc-heap-low-threshold' for a
 *      period of 3 minutes.
