/*
 * Detects BGP neighbor advertised route count threshold breaches and notifies
 * when anomalies are found.
 * Four inputs control detection
 * 
 *   1) "neighbors" is a regular expression that matches the BGP neighbors
 *      that you would like to monitor.  By default it's '.*', which matches
 *      all BGP neighbors. Use something like '172.16.*' to match all neighbor
 *      addresses which are in 172.16.0.0/16 network range.
 *
 *   2) "routing-instance" is the variable that filters the routing instances.
 *      By default it's ".*", which matches neighbors in all routing instances.
 *      Use something like "master" to match neighbors belongs to only master
 *      routing instance.
 *
 *   3) "addr-table" is the variable that filters the routing address table.
 *      By default it's ".+", which matches all address tables. Use something 
 *      like "IPV4_UNICAST" to match only advertised routes belongs to IPV4
 *      unicast address table.
 *
 *   4) "max-advertised-route-count-threshold" is the threshold that causes the
 *      rule to report an anomaly. By default it's 10000. This rule will set
 *      a dashboard color to red when advertised route count exceed threshold
 *      (max-advertised-route-count-threshold), otherwise color is set to green.
