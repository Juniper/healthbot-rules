/*
 * Detects BGP neighbor flaps and notifies when anomalies are found
 *
 * Two inputs control detection
 *
 *   1) "neighbors" is a regular expression that matches the BGP neighbors
 *      that you would like to monitor.  By default it's '.*', which matches
 *      all BGP neighbors. Use something like '172.16.*' to match all neighbor
 *      addresses which are in 172.16.0.0/16 network range.
 *
 *   2) "flaps-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to report
 *      an anomaly.  By default it's 1. This rule will set a dashboard
 *      color to red when any of the BGP neighbor session flap-increases
 *      are greater than 'flaps-threshold' for 60s. If it sees any flaps
 *      increase for a period of less than 60s, it'll turn the color to
 *      yellow, otherwise color is set to green.
