/*
 * Detects BGP neighbor state and notifies when anomalies are found
 *
 * Inputs control detection
 *
 *   1) "neighbors" is a regular expression that matches the BGP neighbors
 *      that you would like to monitor.  By default it's '.*', which matches
 *      all BGP neighbors. Use something like '172.16.*' to match all neighbor
 *      addresses which are in 172.16.0.0/16 network range.
