/*
 * Detects LLDP (session) state changes and notifies when anomalies are found.
 * Six inputs control detection
 * 
 *   1) "if-name" is a regular expression that matches the
 *      interfaces that you would like to monitor.  By default it's
 *      '.*', which matches all interfaces. Use something like 'ge.*' to
 *      match only gigabit ethernet interfaces.
 *
 *   2) "frame-discards-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to 
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 1. This rule will set a dashboard
 *      color to red when LLDP frame discards are greater than 
 *      'frame-discards-threshold' for 3 minutes period, otherwise color is set
 *      to green.
 *
 *   3) "frame-error-in-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 1. This rule will set a dashboard
 *      color to red when LLDP frame in errors are greater than 
 *      'frame-error-in-threshold' for 3 minutes period, otherwise color is set
 *      to green.
 *
 *   4) "frame-error-out-threshold"is the threshold that causes the rule to 
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 1. This rule will set a dashboard
 *      color to red when LLDP frame out errors are greater than 
 *      'frame-error-out-threshold' for 3 minutes period, otherwise color is 
 *      set to green.
 *
 *   5) "tlv-discards-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to report
 *      an anomaly. By default it's 1. This rule will set a dashboard color
 *      to red when TLV discards are greater than 'tlv-discards-threshold'
 *       for 3 minutes period, otherwise color is set to green.
 *
 *   6) "unknown-tlvs-threshold" is the threshold that causes the rule to report
 *      an anomaly. By default it's 1. This rule will set a dashboard color to
 *      red when unknown TLV count is greater than 'unknown-tlvs-threshold' 
 *      for 3 minutes period, otherwise color is set to green.
