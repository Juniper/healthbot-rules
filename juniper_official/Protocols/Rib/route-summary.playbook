/*
 * Playbook contains multiple rules which monitors each route-table's and 
 * protocol's router count and notifies when anomalies are found.
 *
 * 1) Rule "check-ascertain-routes" sets the dynamic thresholds based on 
 *    the learned data (route count of each table) using ML(Machine Learning)
 *    algorithms and detects threshold breaches and notify anomalies.
 *
 * 2) Rule "check-protocol-route-coun" sets the dynamic thresholds based on 
 *    learned data (route count of each protocol) using ML(Machine Learning)
 *    algorithms and detects threshold breaches and notify anomalies.
