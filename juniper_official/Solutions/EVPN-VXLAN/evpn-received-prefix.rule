/*
 * Detects BGP neighbor received route count threshold breaches and notifies
 * when anomalies are found.
 * Two inputs control detection
 *
 *   1) "addr-table" is a regular expression that matches the BGP evpn table
 *      that you would like to monitor.By default it's 'default-switch.evpn.0'
 *
 *   2) "max-route-threshold"  is the threshold that causes the
 *      rule to report an anomaly. By default it's 10000. This rule will set
 *      a dashboard color to red when received route count exceeds threshold
 *
