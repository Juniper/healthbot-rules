		> More details:
		 Sends ICMP probes to user specified destination host and notifies anomalies
		 when round trip time average response is above static or dynamic thresholds.
		 And also detects outlier across the devices in device group ML algorithms.
		 Three inputs control detection
		
		   1) host-var, is a destination IP or host name where ICMP probes send
		      periodically.
		   2) count-var, is a ICMP ping count. By default count is set to 1.
		   3) rtt-threshold-var, is the threshold that causes the rule to report an
		      anomaly. By default it is 1000 micro seconds. This rule will set a
		      dashboard color to red when ICMP response time is greater than static
		      threshold 'rtt-threshold-var'.
