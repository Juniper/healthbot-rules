/*
 * Playbook contains multiple rules which monitors standalone SRX's system,
 * linecard, SPU's CPU & Memory and security parameters and notifies when
 * anomalies are found.
 *
 * 1) Rule "check-spu-performance-netconf" collects SPU performance for each
 *    PIC and notifies in case of stats is above threshold.
 * 2) Rule "check-flow-session-summary-netconf" collects and monitors the
 *    active flow session details and notifies anomalies.
 * 3) Rule "check-fpc-cpu-memory-usage-netconf" collects system FPC CPU
 *    statistics periodically and notifies anomalies when CPU utilization 
 *    exceed threshold.
 * 4) Rule "check-interface-in-out-traffic-snmp" collects input and output
 *    traffic periodically and notifies in case of traffic is above threshold.
 * 5) Rule "check-system-cpu-memory-snmp" collects CPU, Memory Utilization
 *    details from Routing Engines and notify anomalies based on threshold values.
