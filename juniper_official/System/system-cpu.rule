/*
 * Detects RE CPU utilization threshold breaches and notifies when anomalies
 * are found.
 * Three inputs control detection
 * 
 *   1) re-slot-no, is a regular expression that matches the routing engine
 *      that you would like to monitor.  By default it's '0-1', which matches
 *      both the routing engines. Use something like '0' to match only
 *      routing engine 0.
 * 
 *   2) re-cpu-high-threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
 *      an anomaly. By default it's 80% of CPU utilization. This rule will set
 *      a dashboard color to red when RE CPU utilization exceeds high threshold
 *      're-cpu-high-threshold' for a period of 5 minutes.
 * 
 *   3) re-cpu-low-threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
 *      an anomaly. By default it's 50% of CPU utilization. This rule will set 
 *      a dashboard color to yellow when RE CPU utilization exceeds low 
 *      threshold 're-cpu-low-threshold' for a period of 5 minutes.
 *      Otherwise color is set to green.
