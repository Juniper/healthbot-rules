/*
 * Detects RE memory buffer utilization threshold breaches and notifies when
 * anomalies are found.
 * Three inputs control detection
 * 
 *   1) re_slot_No, is a regular expression that matches the routing engine
 *      that you would like to monitor.  By default it's '0-1', which matches
 *      both the routing engines. Use something like '0' to match only
 *      routing engine 0.
 * 
 *   2) memory-buffer-re-high-threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule
 *      to report an anomaly. By default it's 75% of memory utilization. 
 *      This rule will set a dashboard color to red when RE memory buffer
 *      utilization exceed high threshold'memory-buffer-re-high-threshold'
 *      for a period of 5 minutes.
 * 
 *   3)  memory-buffer-re-low-threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule
 *      to report an anomaly. By default it's 50% of memory utilization. 
 *      This rule will set a dashboard color to red when RE memory buffer
 *      utilization exceed high threshold'memory-buffer-re-low-threshold'
 *      for a period of 5 minutes. Otherwise color is set to green.
