/*
 * Detects junos processes (daemons) memory utilization threshold breaches and
 * notifies when anomalies are found.
 * Three inputs control detection
 * 
 *   1) process_name, is a regular expression that matches the daemons that you
 *      would like to monitor. By default it's '.*', which matches all daemons.
 *      Use something like 'rpd|dfwd|dcd' to match only routing, firewall and
 *      interface daemons.
 * 
 *   2) process_memory_high_threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule 
 *      to report an anomaly. By default it's 80% of daemon memory utilization. 
 *      This rule will set a dashboard color to red when daemon memory 
 *      utilization exceed high threshold 'process_memory_high_threshold'
 *      for a period of 5 minutes.
 * 
 *   3) process_memory_low_threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 50% of daemon memory utilization. 
 *      This rule will set a dashboard color to red when daemon memory 
 *      utilization exceed low threshold 'process_memory_low_threshold'
 *      for a period of 5 minutes. Otherwise color is set to green.
