/*
 * Detects system storage utilization threshold breaches and notifies when
 * anomalies are found.
 * Two inputs control detection
 * 
 *   1) storage_usage_high_threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to
 *      report an anomaly.  By default it's 80% of total size. This rule will
 *      set a dashboard color to red when storage used exceed
 *      'storage_usage_high_threshold'.
 * 
 *   2) storage_usage_low_threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to
 *      report an anomaly. By default it's 50%. This rule will set a dashboard
 *      color to green when storage used below 'storage_usage_low_threshold'.
 *      otherwise color is set to yellow as used % is between 50% and 80%.
