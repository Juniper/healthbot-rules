/*
 * Detects VMhost cpu utilization and notifies when anomalies are found.
 *	
 * Two input control detection
 *
 * 1) cpu-name-variable, is a regular expression that matches the cpu that you
 *  would like to monitor.  By default it's '.*', which matches all cpu's.
 *  
 * 2) cpu-threshold-variable, is the threshold that causes the rule to report an
 *  anomaly. By default it's 80. This rule will set a dashboard color to red
 *  when *all* the cpu-utilisation-increases are greater than
 *  'cpu-threshold-variable' for 5 mins or more. If it sees any cpu-utilisation
 *  increase by more than threshold-variable, it'll turn the color to yellow,
 *  else color is set to green.
